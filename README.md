# Edu_agent

An educational AI agent designed to assist learners by providing interactive explanations and guidance through a backend service.  
This project is built in the context of an assessment to demonstrate the design and implementation of an educational agent system.

## 📌 Project Overview

`edu_agent` implements an educational agent that acts as a learning assistant.  
The agent is structured as a backend application, making it easy to trigger, evaluate, and extend its educational behavior via code or APIs.

The focus of this project is not only on the agent itself, but also on:
- clean project structure
- separation of concerns
- assessment-ready design

## 🎯 Problem It Solves

Traditional learning resources are often static and non-interactive.  
This project addresses that by providing an **AI-powered educational agent** that can:
- respond to learning queries
- explain concepts interactively
- be evaluated consistently in an assessment setting

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- Educational AI agent logic encapsulated in a dedicated module
- Backend-driven architecture for easy integration and testing
- Designed for demonstration and evaluation purposes
- Simple and extensible codebase
